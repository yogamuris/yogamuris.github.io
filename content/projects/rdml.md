## Introduction
A website for retinopathy diabetic prediction. To predict the retinopathy diabetic occurence, I build the model using machine learning approach. The model that i was build, publised at [this link](http://jurnal.fikom.umi.ac.id/index.php/ILKOM/article/view/578).

This project can be access through [this link](https://adyglr.herokuapp.com/).

## Tech Stack
Prediction model developed with Python and sklearn library. I used Python as the backend with Flask framework.
