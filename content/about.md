I love to create things using software engineering. My first project was to create a simple profile app using Macromedia Flash and Actionscript when I was in Junior Highschool. From this project, I learned about the user interface and the logic that connects the user interface. This project gave me a passion to learn about programming and information technology. This passion carried me to my college education. I learn about new programming languages, algorithms, also data structures. 

In college, I begin my journey in software engineering. I was a co-founder and software engineer in Zeniora Education, a startup that focuses on a college preparation test for a senior high school student. At Zeniora Education, I helped build the core products and scaled the engineering team.
